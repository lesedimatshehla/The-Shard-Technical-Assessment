My task was to choose one of an open-source datasets of publicly available credit/loan dataset. I have selected German Credit Data (UCI Machine Learning Repository).
Then downloaded "statlog+german+credit+data.zip" folder which contained german.data-numeric, Index and german.data text files.
German word document explained instructions of how to read my attribution columns.
Afterwards I have imported the text data into excel using "Data tab" on the ribbon.
Navigate to "Get & Transform Data", click drop-down arrow, select "From File", select "From Text/CSV", follow instructions to select name of the data saved in folder as "All Files".
On the pop-up power query preview, select drop-down next to "Load", select "Load to Table".
Select "Table" on the "Import Data" pop-up, click "OK".
A table will be loaded into excel sheet and you will see "Queries & Connections" on your right side of the loaded table.
Double-click name of the table with number of rows loaded under "Queries".
This will open "Power Query Editor" with the loaded table name.
Right click each column, click "Rename..." to write correct attribute name.
Right click the qualitative value columns, click "Duplicate Column".
Drag the column next to the respective original column.
Right click the column, click "Rename..." to write correct attribute name.
Right click the column, click "Replace Values...", after "Replace Values" pop-up, fill in the "Value To Find" and "Replace With" right attribute description and click "OK".
Additional steps to manipulate data are on the "Power Query" ribbon.
Click "Advanced Editor" on the "Power Query" ribbon, then view your code on the "Advanced Editor" pop-up.
On completion of these, you will be able to process different types of data using "Power Query".
The prepared data will allow you to do further investigation like inserting pivot tables and charts on the excel ribbon tabs.
You need to know how to add-in excel data analysis like "Data Analysis" to calculate summary statistics.
